        <h2>Slurping</h2>
         <p>Slurp away your noodles and soup!</p>
         <p>Slurping cools off the hot noodles and improves the flavor but most importantly, it shows enjoyment of food

        <h2>Drink Selections</h2>
         <p>Usually, green tea is served with all the meals.
          When you drink alcohol with others, wait till everyone has their first drink and raise your drink with others and say, "Kanpai" means "Cheers".
          Avoid pouring your own drink. Instead, pouring for someone else is a kind gesture that will usually get the other person to pour for you.</p><br>
